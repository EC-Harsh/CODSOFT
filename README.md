As an intern in CodSoft, I have completed 2 Tasks that are: 1. Alarm App 2. Todo List App.
During the internship I learned a lot about Android Development, this internship helped me to dive deeper into the field of Android Development.

Following are some features of the Alarm Clock App:
* User can choose their favorite sound as their alarm tune.
* Can stop the alarm whenever they want.

Following are some features of the Todo List App:
* User can add tasks of their own.
* They can see all tasks either completed or pending.
* Default screen will be of pending tasks.
* They can right-swipe to set the task complete.
* They can left-swipe to remove the task from the pending list.
